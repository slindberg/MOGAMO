# Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Meta-optimization

This project performs a meta-optimization on MATLAB's `gamultiobj()` function for finding the Pareto front of multi-objective optimization problems using a GA based on NSGA-II.

## Usage

The root script is `MOGAMO.m`, open it in MATLAB and run from the project directory.
